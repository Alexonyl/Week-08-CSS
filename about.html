    <p>Born in 1998, in West Plains, Missouri, I began my journey in 2014. I enrolled in Missouri State University in West Plains.
        This started my discovery of who I am and what interests me. I began realizing my interest in art was more than doing simple drawings in high school.
        I began taking art classes as electives and fell in love with the discussions of art on a completely different level. </p>

    <p> I had always been fascinated with animated movies and cartoons. I loved the colors and dynamism of the movement and characters.
        The digital world was more appealing than the academic world I was used to being in.
        So many artists were able to capture complex feelings and emotions in seemingly more unconventional ways. I was captivated by this whole other world. </p>
        
    <p> I graduated from MSU-West Plains in 2016 and continued my formal education at Missouri State University in Springfield.
        I continued to battle with myself over choosing my passion or going with a “safer option”.
        Eventually, my need to create won, and I graduated in May 2022. I showcased my work in the Brick City Gallery in Springfield, Missouri in April-May 2022.
        I have also continued my education with a Front End Coding Bootcamp, that I will complete in April of 2023.</p>
